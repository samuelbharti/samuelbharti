### Hi, I'm Sam ðŸ‘‹

I'm a bioinformatics engineer and Shiny app developer. I currently work at AI.MED Lab on the feature association and population sub-type prediction.

I'm passionate about working on bioinformatics projects & building thriving communities around them. Check out my recent work on designing and developing [SEAS (Statistical Enrichment Analysis of Samples)](http://discovery.informatics.uab.edu/SEAS/), which can be used to perform clinical feature prediction and enrichment analysis among other applications.

Hire me for developing amazing R shiny applications.
